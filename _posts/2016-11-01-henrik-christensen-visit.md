## Talk: Object Based Mapping
### Abstract

To build mobile systems that can operate autonomously it is necessary to endow them with a sense of location. One of the basic aspects of autonomy is the ability to not get lost. How can we build robots that acquire a model of the surrounding world and utilize these models to achieve their mission without getting lost along the way? Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is widely used to provide the mapping and localization compete to robots. The process has three facets: extraction of features from sensor data, association of features with prior detected structures and estimation of position/pose and update of the map to make it current. The estimation part of the process is today typically performed using graphical models to allow for efficient computations and enable flexible handling of ambiguous situations. In this presentation we will discuss our modular mapping framework - OmniMapper - and how it can be utilized across a range of different applications for efficient computing. We will discuss a number of different strategies for object detection and pose estimation and also provide examples of mapping across a number of different sensory modalities. Finally we will show a number of examples of use of the OmniMapper across in- and out-door settings using air and ground vehicles.
