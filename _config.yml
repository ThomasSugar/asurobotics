- description: My current research and publications concern the identification of
    injury mechanisms and quantification of sensorimotor deficits and movement disorders
    associated with aging and neurological disorders on fall accidents. I have academic
    grounding in biomechanical modeling, nonlinear dynamical systems, human postural
    control, and gait mechanics, which underscore a fundamental capacity to provide
    unique clinical solutions to injury preventions utilizing both engineering and
    biomedical principles

  lab_description: 'We have created an interdisciplinary research laboratory capable
    of addressing the needs of the older adults by focusing on fall prevention utilizing
    mobile, wireless, ubiquitous and gait sensing technologies.  Injuries associated
    with fall incidences continue to pose a significant burden to older adults both
    in terms of human suffering and economic losses.  Among older adults, falls are
    a growing public health concern, responsible for over 424,000 deaths and 37.3
    million emergency department visits worldwide (WHO, 2012), and 30,209 deaths and
    2.4 million emergency department visits nationwide costing over $67.7 billion
    annually (CDC, 2015).  The strategic partners include Barrow Neurological Institute
    and Mayo Clinic researchers focusing on rehabilitation and fall prevention and
    ASU researchers focusing human factors, gaming, sensing, machine learning and
    software engineering.

    Our lab offers the opportunity for an inter-disciplinary team of scientific, engineering,
    health care, and business professionals to collaborate under one physical and
    organizational structure dedicated to rapid development of interactive fall prevention
    technologies.  The facility houses a comprehensive suite of instrumentation that
    enables end-to-end development of devices/intervention methods for rapid reduction
    to clinical practice.  '
