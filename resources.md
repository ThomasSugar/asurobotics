The Polytechnic School, one of the six Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University, is ideally equipped to perform the research duties outlined in this proposal.  Research on the Polytechnic campus will primarily take place in the Technology Building, which is currently expanding its research capabilities to encompass an ~ 875 square-foot motion-capture lab and seven new robotics and manufacturing lab spaces by June 2016.  

The primary lab space will occupy ~500 square feet, with all the necessary utilities and supply lines routed to the space.  Secondary manufacturing space is also available in the ``Startup Lab'', a 15,000 ft$^2$ general-purpose fabrication and development area in the Technology Building which houses many of the larger shared pieces of fabrication equipment which will be used to build robots.


### Equipment

We will utilize equipment in the primary lab space and the Startup Lab to rapidly manufacture hybrid walking robots.  The primary lab space will have all the necessary tools for lamination and hybrid manufacturing, including an impulse sealer, a 27-inch roll laminator, a small CNC router for material removal, and a MakerGear M2 3d printer.

The Startup Lab has several important pieces of equipment as well, including: A Shop Bot Wood 3D Router, a 50 Watt Epilog Laser Engraver and Cutter, a 90-Watt large-bed Full Spectrum laser cutter, a multi-material Objet Connex3 350 printer, an Objet 30 printer, and several ABS plastic 3D printers including a Dimension Elite, a Fortus 450, a Fortus 250, a UPrint, and four Lulzbot Minis.  We will also use the micro scribe digitizer probe, the 3D Scanner, Vinyl Cutter, Sewing Machine, Vacuum Former, Injection Molding Press and the variety of hand tools which are also available as needed.
